## Description

For this assignment I was tasked with creating an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. I used Express.js for routing, MongoDB for the database, and the Mongoose ODM. 

This project helped me to better familiarize myself with MongoDB, as well as using Insomnia to test my API routes. 

## Installation

This repo is not deployed, but the API routes can be tested by downloading the repo files, installing MongoDB, and running the following on the command line:
 ```
    - npm init -y
    - npm install express
    - npm install mongoose
    - npm install moment
    - npm start
```
Once the server is started by running npm start, you can open Insomnia and test the API routes as shown in the Video Walkthrough below.

## Usage

Below is a screenshot of the API routes in Insomnia, as well as a walkthrough video showing the various routes.
